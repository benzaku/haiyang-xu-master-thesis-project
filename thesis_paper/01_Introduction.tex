With the ever fast development of modern computer science, computer graphics and visualization has become a big topic. And with the more and more advanced 3D scanner and surface reconstruction technology, people are able to get extremely large 3D model with much more detail than ever before that are scanned from real objects such as sculptures. 
And mean while, in recent years, various mobile devices (such as iPhone, iPad, Google Nexus series, etc.) with much powerful computing resource are being designed and manufactured. With faster CPU/GPU and larger memory, these hand-held devices are made possible to run graphics programs or to view 3D models. These two trends have raised many topics about graphics development on mobile devices. The visualisation of large-scale 3D model is one of the hot topics among them. 

\smallskip

In this thesis, we proposed a streaming framework for large scale geometry models. In this framework users can connect our server from a mobile device (e.g. iPad) and view the 3D geometry model they choose progressively. User can browse the model using drag-and-zoom gesture on the multi-touch screen of the device and the system will refine the corresponding part of the viewing model according to users' viewing angle. Therefore our system can provide view-dependent, selective geometry streaming. 

\smallskip
In the following paragraphs of this chapter, we will introduce in detail the motivation of the thesis in Section~\ref{section:motivation}. And in Section~\ref{section:background} we will introduce the background of this topic. And Section~\ref{section:relWork} related works in the area of this topic will be listed and discussed. 

\smallskip
And then In Chapter~\ref{chapter:BasicConcepts}, we will describe some basic theoretical and technical concepts behind the topic of this thesis including \emph{Progressive Mesh}, the \emph{Quadric Error Metrics}, \emph{View-dependent Progressive Mesh}, \etc

\smallskip
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:SystemDesign}, we will describe the overall system architecture design including the server architecture and client architecture. 

\smallskip
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:SystemImplementation}, we will describe in detail about the implementation of our geometry streaming framework. In this chapter, both server and client side implementation will be illustrated. And after that there will be a short discussion of the implementation. 

\smallskip
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:ExperimentalEvaluation} and Chapter~\ref{chapter:CollaborationWithOtherProjects} we will show the experiment result of our framework and we will also describe the use of our framework in other projects. 

In the last chapter, we will conclude this thesis. Future work will also be discussed in this chapter.
